## Refactor existing code to make the website more accessible.  

.Week 1 homework: Refactor webpage for accessibility 

    The provided code was functional but messy.  It didnt have very clear indentation, which made it difficult to read.  The over use of ids caused redundant CSS code that could have easily use classes.  I created a reset CSS to aid in the ability to use across many browsers.  Cleaned up the code and used as many symantic attributes as i could.

    This assignment was a challenge, but it finally came together.  I tried using as much of what I know so far, and did a lot of Googling to figure things out.
